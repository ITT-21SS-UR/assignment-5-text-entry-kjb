The Authors implemented a phrase-level input keyboard that is able to help correct previous text based 
on subsequently input sequences, the "PhraseFlow"-Keyboard. Through the research on phrase level typing based
on multiple versions of the prototype, they validated different results. Phrase-level decoding has higher
accuracy on correction tasks than word-level decoding, including space-related errors. Furthermore the 
prototype was enhanced by creating visual feedback effects and interaction methods which have reduced the 
cognitive load of phrase level input. Through development and in-lab studies, the authors identified 
behaviour and cognitive patterns while using the prototype, resulting in 19% fewer errors with no effects 
on the speed. It demonstrated the practicability of the phrase-level decoding in real typing settings.

Hummer: Text Entry by Gaze and Hum. 2021. CHI '21: Proceedings

The authors implemented "Hummer", a novel bi-modal method for hands-free text entry combining eye-tracking
and humming. By analysing gaze paths that are temporally constrained by humming, they reviews related
literature to converge to word-level text entry. They designed to different models. The first one "HumHum"
requires short hums , the second one "Hummer" continuous humming to define the start and the end of a word.
They also compared it to a gaze-only method "EyeSwipe" in both quantitive and qualitive measures.
The results are "Hummer" provided a signficantly faster text-entry speed than the gaze-based hands-free
method "EyeSwipe", with a speed of 20.45 words per minute. Furthermore the feedback indicates a clear
preference for Hummer as a comfortable, fast and easy to learn method for text entry. The participants
enjoyed the combination of humming and swiping in a ryhthm.

Hidden Interaction Techniques: Concealed Information Acquisition and Texting 
on Smartphones and Wearables. CHI '21: Proceedings of the 2021 CHI Conference 
on Human Factors in Computing Systems. Association for Computing Machinery, 
New York, NY, USA, May 2021 Article No.: 248 Pages 1–14

In this paper, the authors explored the concept of hidden interaction techniques through two 
prototype applications: "HiddenHaptics" is is an app which allows the user to receive informations 
through vibrotactile cues on the smartphone and "HideWrite" provides the user possibility to write 
text messages by drawing on their dimmed smartwatch screen. To investigate if the applications
can be used without being expoesed, the authors conducted three different user studies.
The design goals for the two applications were that they are easy to lern, they work on off-the-
shelf devices without external hardware, they do not give visual output and the user do not look
at the device during interaction. The results of the study where that the user could effectively 
hide their interaction using the hidden techniques, with "HandWrite" only 1 of the 11 observers
noticed the interaction, with "HiddenHaptics" 93,3% were successful. The User tended to hide the 
device by holding it behind their backs, keeping it in their pockets or by using objects like the 
table. The last finding was that the user could still commit to the ongoing social activities despite
their interaction with the applications.
